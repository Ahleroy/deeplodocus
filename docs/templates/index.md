# How to ride a Deeplodocus


## What is Deeplodocus ?

Deeplodocus is a High Level deep learning framework offering a large flexibility for both research and production projects.
Deeplodocus is multi-platform, pure Python and relies on the PyTorch backend.

## Why another Deep framework ?

From our experience, the deep learning projects need being more structured in order to be scaled and gain efficiency in the implementation.

Deeplodocus offers a common structure similar to a web framework which allows everyone to create a project with a minimum amount of code while still being able to keep the flexibility of the backend implementation.
