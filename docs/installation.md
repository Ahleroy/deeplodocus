# Install Deeplodocus

There are multiple way to install Deeplodocus :

- From PIP

Whatever the solution you want to use, you will need PyTorch installed on your computer.

In order to install PyTorch we recommend you to go to [pytorch.org](pytorch.org). Follow the installation instruction and come back once the PyTorch library is installed.


## Install from PIP

In order to install Deeplodocus from PIP, you can simply enter the following line in your terminal

`pip3 install deeplodocus`

Some installation would work with the folloing command :

`python3 -m pip install deeplodocus`

or

`python3 -m pip install deeplodocus --user`

Use the command the suits the best your system.


## Install from Github

The installation from Github allows you to have access to the last functionalities. Yet, we do not assure this version is stable.
We mainly recommend to use this version if you contribute to the development of Deeplodocus.
