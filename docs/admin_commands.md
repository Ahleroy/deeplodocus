# Admin Commands

## Start Project

You can build a Deeplodocus project using :

`deeplodocus startproject <my_project_name>`

This command will build a Deeplodocus project within the folder you are currently using.
If you do not give any name to the project, Deeplodocus will allocate a default name with the current time to the project.

The structure generated will be the one described in the [Structure page](deeplodocus.org/master/en/structure).

Note : `start-project` and `start_project` work as well

## Version

You can print the version of the installed Deeplodocus package:

`deeplodocus version`

## Help

You can list the different Admin commands using :

`deeplodocus help`

This is displayed by default if a wrong command is entered.
