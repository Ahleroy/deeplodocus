#Deeplodocus

##Introduction:
Initially created by both A. Leroy and S. Westlake, PhD candidates at Cranfield University, Deeplodocus is a high-level framework with the objective to help to create, train, analyze and test deep networks.
Initially based on Keras, the framework is rewritten from scratch in a modular, flexible and config file based fashion. 
The current supported backed is PyTorch but you are more than welcome to contribute to  integrate another library.

Deeplodocus embeds functionalities such as : 

- Smart and automatic data loading
- Data augmentation / transformation 
- Metrics and losses display during training, validation and test stages
- Save of the results (model, weights and metrics)
- Custom loss and metrics
- Explicit logs system
- Training configuration from config files
- And more !

All the Deeplodocus parameters are available in the config files.

Deeplodocus is designed to be crossplatform (Windows, Linux and Mac OS). It uses Python 3.5+.


## Installation

### PIP

`pip install deeplodocus`



### Required packages

* PyTorch (v0.4.0+)
* cv2 (3.1.4+)


##Roadmap : 


* Callbacks
* History
* Saving the model
* Smart saving
* Dataset Loader [âœ“]
* Data checker
* Data Augmentation
* Transformations
* Filters
* Augmentation modes

## Create a Deeplodocus project

Open a terminal / command line and enter :


`deeplodocus create-project "project-name"`

replacing "project-name" by the name of your project


This command will generate the following structure in the current folder :
- Main.py (Main file)
- Config folder
- Logs folder
- Results folder
- Model folder
- Losses folder
- Metrics folder
- Possible other folders to be defined




# Structure :

The current structure of Deepldocus is as described by this schema :

INSERT FIGURE

## Entries

Deeplodocus is composed of 3 entries:
- Deeplodocus Admin : A terminal / command line entry to create a Deeplodocus project 
- Deepldocus Brain : A main script file entry to train / test a deep network
- Deeplodocus UI : A browser access to an interface to configure and use Deeplodocus

### Deeplodocus Admin

The command line entry permits to access functions in the Deeplodocus admin system such as creating a Deeplodocus project

To access the admin commands just enter `deeplodocus` in the terminal followed by the required command.


### Deeplodocus Brain

Deeplodocus Brain is available through the Brain class.
A brain instance gives access to all the functionalities of Deeplodocus such as training or testing the network. It is also possible to access the brain using the main file generated by Deeplodocus Admin.

### Deeplodocus UI :

Using the terminal and modifying the config files may lead to errors that will cost time in the development of a network.
The Deeplodocus team develops a web interface permitting to :

- Define and generate dynamically config files
- Visualise the metrics in real time
- Visualise the generate network (graph)
- Previsualize data augmentation/transforms on the dataset
- ...


## Notifications :

Deeplodocus comes with a notification system. The current system is composed of 5 different notification categories :

- Info (blue) : Display a generic information to the user (default)
- Success (green) : Display a successful action result
- Warning (yellow) : Display a warning
- Error (red) : Display a no-blocking error to the user
- Fatal error (white with red background) : Display a blocking error to the user. Stops the brain

All notifications are saved into a log file in `logs/notification-datetime.logs`


## Data

Data are loaded by Deeplodocus through two interfaces :
 - Dataset
 - Dataloader
 
### Dataset

The Dataset has two main objectives :
- Automatically read, check the completeness and format the data given in the config files in folders and files
- Open, augment/transform the data before being transmitted to the network


### Dataloader

The Dataloader can call the Dataset in parralel of the training using the CPU.
The data are assembled into batches and then sent to the "Trainer" or the "Tester"

NOTE : Currently the Dataloader is provided by the PyTorch's Dataloader.
